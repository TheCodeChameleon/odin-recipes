    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p><b>Feijoada</b> is a typical dish from Rio de Janeiro and is widely consumed throughout Brazil. Despite being a dish with many variations, the typical complete feijoada is the one that takes all the salted meat (rib, various sausages, dried meat, foot, ear, tail, loin, bacon) and is served with slices of orange, saut√©ed cabbage in garlic, rice and farofa.</p>
  
    <p>Because it is considered a heavy dish, there are those who prefer to make the feijoada simple: for this, you can bet on using only sausage, bacon and dried meat, leaving your feijoada dish lighter without losing flavor.</p>
